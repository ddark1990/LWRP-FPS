  ItemDescription: "The Revolver is cheap, prime for early game use. Although inaccurate,
    the Revolver's quick rate of fire allows it hold its own against players at most
    stages. Being a revolver, it has a low capacity of just 8 shots, but it's still
    an upgrade from its 1- and 2- shot alternatives.\r\n\r\nTaking a Revolver to a
    fight against opponents with metal armor is quite risky, as such opponents will
    take many more shots than normal to take out (even more so considering the small
    capacity). It is best advised to only use the Revolver against opponents with
    similar armaments or as a sidearm to another weapon."
