  ItemName: 'Bolt Action Rifle '
  ItemDescription: The Bolt Action Rifle is a powerful late game rifle that offers
    high accuracy and high damage at the cost of speed. Having the most damage and
    least spread of any weapon, it is often used as a designated sniper rifle, and
    is commonly fitted with a scope to increase the sight range for the user. Its
    slow rate of fire greatly limits its use in close quarters combat, and its limited
    capacity forces users to take shots very carefully. Having a very fast bullet
    velocity, users need not lead targets or compensate for gravity as much as with
    other weapons firing a slower bullet.
